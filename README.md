# loverly-frankenstein


The loverly node-js model layer that allows a unified hierarchical structure on 
top of an assortment of data-storage engines.  Want a nice JSON-based document 
on top of a MySQL data store? No problem! __loverly-frankenstein__ is here to

The goal of this module is to abstract the underlying data storage engines from 
the end-user's interactions, creating a clean easy-to-use presentation layer that 
can fit into a standardized REST API.
